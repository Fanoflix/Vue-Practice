# Vue Fundamentals
 Jotting down core features of Vue in the form of commits. Can be used for revision or learning.

### ___________________________________________
##### Why make a Github Repository for this?
###### Mostly just for me, as I wanted all Vue core features and concepts in one place. So that whenever I revisit Vue after taking a break for whatever reason I would be able to refresh it all.
